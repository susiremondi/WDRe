          My favorite food is without a doubt Tillamook Medium Cheddar Cheese.
          It is not the best cheese according to most "cheese experts" but it
          suits my taste just fine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next time you find yourself with some cheddar cheese, try this
          delicious recipe!
        </p>
          
        <ul>
          <li>get a ceramic microwaveable plate</li>
          <li>get a block of cheese and a cheese plane</li>
          <li>slice the cheese thinly and cover the plate</li>
          <li>cover the first layer of thinly sliced cheese with a second layer</li>
          <li>put the whole plate into the microwave for three minutes</li>
          <li>watch the cheese bubble and get crispy</li>
          <li>put the cheese in for another minute until you get the desired level or crispy vs gooey cheese.</li>
          <li>pour off the oil that came out of the cheese</li>
          <li>get a knife and scrape off the cripsy gooey goodness.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          It is delicious! It is almost like eating cheez-its. If you are a bit
          disgusted by the idea of eating pure cheese, then put saltines
          underneath the layers of cheese to make a dish of cheese and crackers!
